									<P>
										I am Maximilian Pluskat. My passion is software development and thus my
										motivation to keep learning and improving never ends.
									</P>
									<P>
										Iâ€™m an enthusiast about tech and programming. My interest started back when I
										was 11.
										I started to teach myself programming in Pascal. Over the years, I tried several
										languages like C#, Java, PHP and C++, with the goal to expand my knowledge about
										computers, hardware and software.<br/>
										After several years of trying languages, frameworks and tech stacks, I found my
										home with JS / TS. My focus is based around those for around 3 years now.
										I love modern technologies and have experience with some of the big known
										technologies.<br/>
										Just to name a few: React, Redux, GraphQL, Express, Redis, REST, Styled
										Components.
									</P>
									<P>
										As with programming languages, I tried out all big operating systems.
										Coming from windows, moved to linux for several years and using macos for about
										a year now.
										I am familiar with all of those as my daily os and linux for server applications
										/ administration.
									</P>
									<P>
										I love to work in a team. Especially with like-minded people who enjoy
										programming and
										teamwork. I like to learn from others, from your experiences and the knowledge
										you have
										already gathered, however I also like to share my knowledge with others. I am
										not afraid to
										talk to others about problems of any kind and find the best solution for
										everyone. Within
										the team, the cohesion and sympathy is crucial.
